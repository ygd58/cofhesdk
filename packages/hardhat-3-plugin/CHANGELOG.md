## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 566f126: Remove the legacy `TestBed` mock surface and stop auto-deploying `SimpleTest` through the Hardhat plugins. Core mock contracts still deploy automatically, while tests that need `SimpleTest` should deploy it explicitly from their own artifacts.

  This also removes `TEST_BED_ADDRESS` and cleans up duplicate `SimpleTest` exports from `@cofhe/mock-contracts`.

### Minor Changes

- 50bb3e4: Decode custom errors from deployed mock contracts by name instead of raw hex selectors.

  **`@cofhe/mock-contracts`**

  - Replaced transient storage (`tstore`/`tload`) in `MockACL.sol` with block-number-based storage, removing the EVM `cancun` requirement and lowering the Solidity pragma to `>=0.8.19`.
  - Removed `bytecode` and `deployedBytecode` fields from published artifacts — they are now sourced at runtime from Hardhat's own compilation output.

  **`@cofhe/hardhat-plugin`**

  - Overrides `TASK_COMPILE_SOLIDITY_GET_SOURCE_PATHS` to inject a stub file that imports all mock contracts, so Hardhat compiles them and registers their artifacts. This lets the Hardhat network decode mock contract custom errors by name (e.g. `PermissionInvalid_Expired`) rather than raw hex.
  - Deployment bytecode is now fetched from `hre.artifacts.readArtifact()` instead of the pre-built artifact bundle.

  **`@cofhe/hardhat-3-plugin`**

  - Calls `hre.solidity.build()` during the `hre.created` hook to compile mock contracts once at startup, enabling the EDR to decode their custom errors by name.
  - `deployFixed` and `deployVariable` now source bytecode from `hre.artifacts.readArtifact()`, ensuring the deployed bytecode matches Hardhat's build info — which is required for error decoding on variable-address contracts like `MockACL`.
